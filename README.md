### General Instruction

The term "project root" is used in the document to refer to the level of folder structure where this `README.md` file is located.

This project is built using `gradlew`. 

For Windows users, use `gradlew.bat` at project root. 

For Linux/Mac users, use `gradlew` at project root. 

In the following sections, this script is referred to generally as `gradlew`.

### Prerequisite
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center)
- [Java 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) and above

For Windows users, ensure that paths to Java 8 are correctly added to `System Properties` > `Advanced` > `Environment Variables` > `PATH`.

### Prepare and Denormalize Data
Download zipped data files from [http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs4224/cs4224-project-files.zip](http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs4224/cs4224-project-files.zip).

Unzip the data files and put folders `data-files` and `xact-files` and the csv file inside under folder `project-files` at project root.

Run command `gradlew massage:run` at project root.

### Import Data To Project

Make sure `gradlew massage:run` command is executed successfully before this step.

The `gradlew` script assumes by default that MongoDB runs on IP address `192.168.48.229:27017`. 

To change default IP address, change `mongodb.ip` in file `import/project.properties`. 

If more than one node is involved, the IP address could be from any one of the nodes.

Run command `gradlew import:all` at project root.

This command performs `import:dropCollection` and `import:importData` sequentially. 

### Configure Clients
The file `start-experiment` at project root includes configuration of clients.

The default IP addresses of the nodes are those of nodes allocated to our group. 

The IP addresses can be changed by modifying the value of `hosts` in `start-experiment` file.

The default number of clients is 10. 

To change the number of clients, modify the upper range of loop variable `i`.

Example:

Changing the code from
    
    for i in {1..10}
to
    
    for i in {1..20}
will increase the number of clients from 10 to 20.

It is suggested that the upper range of loop variable `i` in file `stop-experiment` at project root is changed to the same value as in `start-experiment` to ensure consistency and success in termination of clients.
  
### Run Clients
To run clients, run file `start-experiment` at project root.

Results from each client is stored in folder `experiment_log` at project root.

To prematurely terminate all clients, run file `stop-experiment` at project root.

Note that there is no output on command prompt / terminal when clients are run, as specified by requirement of the project. 

However, you may enter any query from the command prompt / terminal shown below. Results of these queries will be output to the screen.

### Available Queries

**New Transaction: `N`**

Format

    N, W_ID, D_ID, C_ID, NUM_ITEMS
	ITEM_NUMBER[i], SUPPLIER_WAREHOUSE[i], QUANTITY[i]
> Process a new transaction from a custormer.
> 
> Note that 1 <= NUM_ITEMS <= 20, i âˆˆ [1,NUM ITEMS]

Examples:

    N,347,7,7,3
    14,10,68
    283,7,40
    312,12,10


**Payment Transaction: `P`**

Format

    P, W_ID, D_ID, C_ID, PAYMENT

> Process a payment made by a customer.

**Delivery Transaction: `D`**

Format

    D, W_ID, CARRIER_ID

> Process the delivery of the oldest yet-to-be-delivered order for each of the 10
districts in a specified warehouse.   

**Order-Status Transaction: `O`**

Format

    O, W_ID, D_ID, C_ID

> Query the status of the last order of a customer

**Stock-level Transaction: `S`**

Format
    S, W_ID, D_ID, T, L

> Examine the items from the last L orders at a specified warehouse district and reports the number of those items that have a stock level below a specified threshold.

**Popular-Item Transaction: `I`**

Format

    I, W_ID, D_ID, L

> Find the most popular item(s) in each of the last L orders at a specified warehouse district. 
> Given two items X and Y in the same order O, X is defined to be more popular than Y in O if the quantity ordered for X in O is greater than the quantity ordered for Y in O.

**Top-Balance Transaction: `T`**

Format

     T     
> Find the top 10 customers ranked in descending order of their outstanding balance payments.
