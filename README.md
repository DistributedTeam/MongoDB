### General Instruction

This project is built using `gradlew`. 

For Windows users, use `gradlew.bat` at project root. 

For Linux/Mac users, use `gradlew` at project root. 

In the following sections, this script is referred to generally as `gradlew`.

### Prerequisite
- MongoDB
- [Java 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) and above

For Windows users, ensure that paths to Java 8 are correctly added to `System Properties` > `Advanced` > `Environment Variables` > `PATH`.

### Prepare and Denormalize Data
Download zipped data files from [http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs4224/cs4224-project-files.zip](http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs4224/cs4224-project-files.zip).

Unzip the data files and put them under folder `project-files` at project root.

Run command `gradlew massage:run`.

### Import Data To Project

Make sure `gradlew massage:run` command is executed successfully before this step.

The `gradlew` script assumes by default that MongoDB runs on IP address `127.0.0.1:27017`. 

To change default IP address, change `cassandra.ip` in file `import/project.properties`. 

If more than one node is involved, the IP address could be from any one of the nodes.

Run command `gradlew import:all`.

This command performs `import:dropCollection` and `import:importData` sequentially.
